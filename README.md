# Pacmen factory Exercise
An Animated Factory that creates Pacmen with the push of a button.
## Project Description:
This is an animated example of a Pacmen Factory which creates Pacman with the push of a button and when the animation starts the created Pacmen will move randomly across the screen at different speeds.
## How to run:
There are two buttons in the page one is for creating pacmen, as many as you want, and the second one is for starting the movement of all the created pacmen. Once the animation has started you can still create new pacmen by pressing the first button.
## Roadmap of future improvements:
I would like to make each pacmen to change images so they would look like they are eating and also when they hit the screen to change images that look to the other side.
